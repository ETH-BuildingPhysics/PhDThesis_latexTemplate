\label{sec: How to cite a paper}

my introduction, I want to cite \citep{Moeng2007} because he is cool, and also \textcite{Pope2000} even cooler. Yeah! The following commands  give:
\begin{itemize}
\item cite: \cite{Moeng2007}
\item citep: \citep{Moeng2007}	
\item citet: \citet{Moeng2007}	
\item textcite: \textcite{Moeng2007}	
\end{itemize}
See \url{http://merkel.zoneo.net/Latex/natbib.php} for more styles.

\section{How to make index}
\label{sec:How to make index}
Direct Numerical Simulation \index{Direct Numerical Simulation} (DNS) resolves all the scales of the problem. As it is an important topic, I have added DNS to the index. Large Eddy Simulation \index{Large Eddy Simulation} (LES) is also in the index. How to build the index:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Build the document with PDFLatex
	\item Build the index with makeIndex
	\item Build the document again with PDFLatex
\end{enumerate}
Most of the latex editor have a buttom/shortcut for makeIndex. See \url{http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing} for more information in indexing.
