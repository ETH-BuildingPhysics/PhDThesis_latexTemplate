# PhDThesis_latexTemplate

A latex template to write a PhD Thesis at ETHZ. This template is largely based
on the one created by Patrick Pletscher. He gives some nice explanations about his
template [here](http://pletscher.org/blog/2013/03/11/thesis.html).

In the original template, some packages are quite tricky to install and to use,
especially the fancy PGF and TikZ. Therefore they are deactivated here. The 
bibliography was also broken (on our computer at least). It is fixed now.

## Installation
Try it and tell us what is needed. We will update this section accordingly.
