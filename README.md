# PhDThesis_latexTemplate

A latex template to write a PhD Thesis at ETHZ. This tamplate is largely based
on the template of Patrick Pletscher. He gives some nice explanations about this
template [here](http://pletscher.org/blog/2013/03/11/thesis.html).

In the original template, some packages are quite tricky to install and to use,
especially the fancy PGF and TikZ. Therefore they are desactivated in this
template. The bibliography was also broken (on our computer at least). It is fixed
now
